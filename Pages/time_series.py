How will hip-hop fare in the future?
To answer this question, let's evaluate its total performance
in terms of the Spotify Top 200 charts. 

The group extracted data from playlists that are marked as hip-hop
and the Spotify Top 200 daily charts data from 2017-2021 which they merged
to get the songs in the Spotify Top 200 daily charts data which are hip-hop

Thh group then summed the data to get a time series of the sum of the number
of streams of hip-hop songs in that Top 200. Below is the time series generated.

Feel Free to interact with the time series to see some interesting points.

In the time series, we see interesting points:

1. A Sudden shift in the number of streams of hip-hop in between the end of 2019 and the start of 2020
2. A sudden spike in hiphop streams at December 31, 2020

First lets analyze that sudden shift in the data starting around late November 2019

From the above data, we can see the following observations:

1. At around November, it was just 2 artists contributing to the total number of streams.
2. By January, we see a significant increase in the number of songs and artists contributing to the sum.

The sudden shift can be explained in 2 ways:

1. People suddenly had an appreciation for hiphop and their songs
2. Hiphop artists gradually increased in number by 2020.

As we can see, there is a significant number of artists contributing to the sum of the number of streams like Lil Nas X, Drake, and Pop Smoke.
However, it is important to also consider the date and the condition this date was in. December 31, 2020 was the first new years
where the world is under lockdown from COVID-19 thus new years celebrations with families were not possible. 

Hip-hop songs are often party songs or known as "Hype", and it seems to be apt in its use in a new year's celebration. As substitute to a normal party outside,
there is an increase in streams through zoom using spotify or streams from people who celebrated alone or with a small group of people.

In short, no party = no party music. What is the substitute for this? Hiphop music.

Given those points, where then is Hiphop heading? Being under a subgenre of hiphop, we want to see a possible upper bound in our client, ABRA's number of streams and popularity.
